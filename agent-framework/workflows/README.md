# 🔄 Workflows

This folder contains examples demonstrating workflow orchestration patterns with Azure AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework.

## 🧠 What are Workflows?

**Workflows** enable you to orchestrate multiple agents, executors, and human-in-the-loop interactions in complex business processes. They provide graph-based execution, streaming responses, and support for patterns like sequential processing, reflection, and multi-agent coordination.
